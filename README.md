========

Why not? :-) 

This cheeky titled framework is an opinionated build and deployment framework for .Net projects.

YDeliver is not
---------------

A replacement for good application agnostic builds like rake. 

How do I get this to work?
--------------------------

Open a PowerShell prompt in the TestProject folder and invoke the build!
<code>
> .\build.bat
</code>

More to come!
-------------

* More information on the rationale behind some of the crazy decisions
* More Unit Test frameworks supports
* Deployment stuff added

VM for TestProject
------------------

* Windows 2008 R2 Web Server
* Set Administrator password to Password2112
* Install VirtualBox Guest Additions

Ideas
-----

* Plugin architecture
* NUnit execution changes between versions
* generate configuration yaml explicitly showing defaults and documentation
* simplify augmenting conventions (unit test path and tools path are good examples)
* how to get started with YDeliver
* Naming { build, install
